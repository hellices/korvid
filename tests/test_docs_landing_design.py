"""Structural invariants for the landing page's design acceptance fixes (Task 4).

Rendered-site acceptance exposed three defects that are structural, not
cosmetic, so they are pinned here rather than left to a human re-reading a
screenshot:

1. **The install command wrapped mid-token on narrow viewports** — the hero
   rendered `brew install hellices/korvid/ko` / `rvid`, which is not a
   command anyone can copy. The fix restores wrapping to token boundaries
   only and lets the container scroll if a single token still does not fit,
   which means the container can be a scrollable region and therefore must
   be keyboard reachable and labelled.
2. **The footer was the bare Material default** ("Made with Material for
   MkDocs" and nothing else). The site now ships an original korvid footer
   partial that carries the mark, the tagline, the useful destinations, and
   the license — while keeping the upstream theme attribution.
3. **The hero was prose in an empty panel at wide widths** — 840px of copy
   inside a 1188px panel. The hero now pairs the copy with the actual product
   media, so the panel is balanced by real product evidence rather than a key
   legend.

These tests read the *sources* (`docs/index.md`, `docs/overrides/**`,
`docs/stylesheets/extra.css`, `mkdocs.yml`) because that is what a future
edit would regress. They deliberately assert on structure and declared
behaviour, not on exact colours or pixel values.
